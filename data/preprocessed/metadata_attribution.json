Even a Spaniard would have been too good to do some of the things he did. Blackbeard would have made his own mother walk the plank as soon as he would a merchant captain. The only thing he was afraid of was ghosts. I remember one night off the north coast of Cuba, it blowing a hurricane at the time, and there was two corposants aloft that scared most of us, but Blackbeard laughed at them, and practiced firing at them with his pistol. But all of a sudden he sung out that he was a dead man, and jumped below. I followed him, for all hands were on the quarter deck, the men being afraid to stay forrard or go below on account of the corposants. Blackbeard had locked himself in his cabin and was callin’ to me to bring him the rum. When I brought it he told me that he had seen the ghost of a woman sittin’ perched on the jaws of the main gaff pointin’ at him with her finger, and that I must tell the mate to bring the schooner up into the wind and shake the ghost off.",

We followed this passage a little distance, finding it widening all the time till we came to a great gallery, wide and high, in which there stood three wooden chests. Two of them were open and empty, but the third contained a great quantity of excellent candles of all sorts; some of them were of wax and at least two feet long, and must have been stolen from some church altar. In the empty chests Blackbeard had doubtless kept his treasure, for I picked up, close to the chests, a small piece of gold which had been dropped there. But I was more pleased to see the candles than I should have been to have found the chests full of diamonds, for I knew our lantern must be nearly burnt out, and that without a light we should never be able to find our way out of the cave.",
